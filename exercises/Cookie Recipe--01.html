	<p><strong>SKILL LEVEL</strong></p>
	<p>Easy</p>

	<p><strong>YIELD</strong></p>
	<p>2 dozen 3-inch cookies</p>

	<h2><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h2>

	<p>&nbsp &#x2022	2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1 2/3 cups bread flour<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1/4 teaspoons baking soda<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1/2 sticks unsalted butter<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 1/4 cups light brown sugar<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 large eggs<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 teaspoons natural vanilla extract<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 cup dark chocolate chips<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 cup milk chocolate chips<br>
	&nbsp	&#x2022 teaspoon sea salt</p>


	<h2><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>

		<p>1.Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.<br>

		2.Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.<br>

		3.Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>

		4.Beat in the vanilla.<br>

		5.Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.<br>

		6.Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.<br>

		7.Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.<br>

		8.When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.<br>

		9.Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.<br>

		10.Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.<br>

		11.Eat warm, with a glass of milk.</p>

	<h2><strong>EXPERT TIPS</strong></h2>

	<p>The secret to richer Chocolate Chip Cookies with a more sophisticated flavor is letting the dough rest for 24 to 36 hours before baking.</p>
